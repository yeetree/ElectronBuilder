		<h1>Electron Builder Documentation/Getting Started</h1>
		<p>Electron Builder is designed to be simple. Electron Builder handles the hard work for you. Thats why the "Documentation" is more like a "Getting Started."</p>
		<h2>Step 1</h2>
		<p>Create your Electron app.</p>
		<h2>Step 2</h2>
		<p>Launch Electron Builder and configure your prefrences</p>
		<h3>Step 2.1 (Optional)</h3>
		<p style="color:red">NOTE: Advanced options isnt working at the moment and will result with an error.</p>
		<p style="color:red">If you still want to add extra options, go to "View/Toggle Developer Tools," and go to the "Console" tab.<br />Press the "Build" button, and copy the command generated in the log. Paste that into your console and modify it. There you can run it.</p>
		<p>Above the "Build" button, click "Show Advanced Options," and add additional flags if needed.</p>
		<p>(Type your flags in as you would normally in electron-packager CLI, E.G. --app-version=1.0.0)</p>
		<h2>Step 3</h2>
		<p>Click "Build" and a log window will show up. You can close Electron Builder when the console window says "Complete. It is now safe to exit Electron Builder."</p>
		<p>(It may include more data as well)</p>
		<h1>Thats it! Enjoy your app!</h1>
